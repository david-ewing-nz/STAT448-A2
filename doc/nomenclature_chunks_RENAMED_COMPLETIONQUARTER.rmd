```{r DAVID-NAMED-2, results='asis'}
The linear regression model predicting actual sales price (V9) offers several key insights regarding model quality, predictor significance, and structural challenges. The following evaluation addresses how well the model fits the data, the relative influence of selected variables, the distribution of residual errors, and any underlying multicollinearity that may affect interpretability or reliability. These diagnostic elements are critical in assessing both the explanatory power and the robustness of the fitted model.
From the summary of the linear regression model, we can find that:

1.Residuals: 
Residuals are roughly symmetric around zero (median = -1.50), indicating indicating unbiased predictions on average.However, residuals range widely (-901.15 to 645.31), suggesting the model struggles with extreme values.

2.Coefficients and Significance：
COMPLETION YEAR (β = 152.1, p < 0.001) and COMPLETIONQUARTER (β = 59.84, p < 0.001): These two variables both have a significant positive impact on the model, indicating that the completion year and quarter are crucial predictors of the outcome.
V3(β = -0.2331, p < 0.001) and V8(β = 1.203, p < 0.001)：V3 has a significant negative impact, while V8 has a significant positive impact,, with V3  stands for  Lot area and V8 to Price of the unit at the beginning of the project per m2.
V1(β = -4.779, p < 0.05) and V2(β = 0.0663, p < 0.05):V1 has a significant negative impact, while V2 has a significant positive impact. at the 0.05 level, with V1  stands for project locality and V2 to total floor area of the buildings.
V5(β = -0.6548, p < 0.1) ：V5 has a marginally significant negative impact,stands for Preliminary estimated construction cost based on the prices at the beginning of the project.
The linear regression model supports the findings from my previous data visualization analysis.

3.Model Performance:
Adjusted R-squared: 0.9848: This tells us that the model explains about 98.48% of the changes in actual sales prices (V9). This shows the model is a good fit for the data.But High R-squared with excessive predictors (75 variables) may harm generalizability. We need careful about the overfitting risk for this model.
F-statistic = 321.9 with a p-value < 2.2e-16, indicating that Model is statistically significant overall.

4.Multicollinearity and undefined coefficients: There are undefined coefficients for 32 predictor variables. This points to a multicollinearity issue. This means some variables are very closely related, making it hard to tell their separate effects. We can use VIF to check for multicollinearity and think about removing or combining variables that are highly correlated.

Compare these two models in terms of outputs, computational time and holdout mean square error. (Hint: summarising your results in a table allows for easy comparison).

```{r DAVID-NAMED-3, results='asis'}
Base on the table above, it can be found that:

Model Complexity:  The Backward Selection model is more complex,retained 44 variables, while  the Stepwise Selection model is simpler but efficient, including fewer predictors retained 23 variables, resulting in a more parsimonious model, which may improve interpretability and generalizability.

Fit Quality:
Both models have almost identical R² values, showing similar explanatory power.
However, Stepwise has a higher adjusted R², which accounts for model complexity 

Model Selection Criteria (AIC & BIC):
Both AIC and BIC are lower for the Stepwise model, suggesting it achieves better fit with fewer variables.That means it strikes a better balance between model complexity and goodness of fit.

Holdout MSE :
The Stepwise model has a much lower MSE on the holdout set, suggesting better predictive performance and generalizability.

Computation Time:
Backward was faster, but given the other metrics, this difference (~3.5s) is likely negligible for most practical purposes.

The Stepwise model is preferred overall: it’s simpler, generalises better, and has better performance on most criteria (especially adjusted R², AIC, BIC, and holdout MSE), despite being a little slower to compute.
```
### d).Fit a linear regression model to explain the “actual sales price” (V9) in terms of other variables (excluding the variable “actual construction costs” (V10)) using (i) Ridge regression (ii) LASSO regression with an appropriate 𝜆 determined by cross validation. Compare these two models in terms of outputs, computational time and cross validation mean square error.



```{r DAVID-NAMED-4, results='asis'}


### e). Please give a possible explanation of why one method is better than the other in this case,considering also results from backwards and stepwise selection.
From the comparison of the four models (Ridge, LASSO, Backward, and Stepwise selection), LASSO demonstrates the best overall performance in this case, and here’s why:

Lower Prediction Error:

LASSO achieves the lowest Holdout MSE (61648.42	) compared to Ridge (92275.39), Backward (89101.99	), and Stepwise (69494.02). This indicates LASSO generalises better to unseen data.Its lower CV MSE (27436.48	) (compared to Ridge’s 48080.05) further validates its robustness.

Computational Efficiency:

LASSO runs much faster (0.125 seconds) than Backward (9.823s) and Stepwise (14.149s), making it scalable for large datasets.Ridge (0.240s) is also fast but performs worse in prediction accuracy.

Variable Sparsity:

LASSO retains only 40 predictors (vs. Ridge’s 108 and Backward’s 43), reducing overfitting risk while maintaining interpretability.Ridge Model keeps all the predictors (108 here), but makes their effects smaller.Stepwise selects fewer predictors (22) but has higher Holdout MSE than LASSO, suggesting it might discard useful variables.

Why LASSO Outperforms Backward/Stepwise:

Automatic Feature Selection: LASSO’s L1 regularization shrinks irrelevant coefficients to exact zero, avoiding the "greedy" pitfalls of stepwise methods, which can get stuck in suboptimal variable subsets.

Handling Multicollinearity: LASSO and Ridge handle correlated predictors better than stepwise methods, which often fail in high-dimensional settings.

While Stepwise is simpler to interpret, its computational cost and higher error make it less practical here.Ridge retains all variables, leading to higher complexity and overfitting.LASSO balances accuracy, speed, and simplicity effectively, making it the superior choice for this dataset. Its ability to select key predictors while minimizing prediction error aligns well with the observed data patterns. 
```

```{r DAVID-NAMED-5, results='asis'}  

The R-squared value of 1 indicates a perfect fit on the training data. However, this is likely due to overfitting, as the model is using 97 predictors with only 30 observations. In such cases, the model memorises the data instead of learning meaningful relationships, which results in poor generalization to new data.

### b). Now use the LASSO to fit the training data, using leave-one-out cross-validation to find the tuning parameter 𝜆. (This means 𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑠 = 30. You will also find it convenient to set 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 = 10\^𝑠𝑒𝑞(3,−1,100) and 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ = 1𝑒 −10). What is the optimal value of 𝜆? and what is the resulting test error?
### c). State your final model for the UPDRS. How many features have been selected? What conclusions can you draw?

```
 
 ```{r DAVID-NAMED-6, results='asis'}
The LASSO regression identified a lambda value (≈1.02) that minimised cross-validated MSE, resulting in a model with only four non-zero coefficients: X9, X82, X83, and X97. This demonstrates strong feature selection capability, improving interpretability and reducing overfitting risks. 
 The resulting formula list below:
$$
\text{UPDRS} = 26.1423 + 0.2039 \times X_9 + 0.0586 \times X_{82} + 0.3937 \times X_{83} + 7.0572 \times X_{97}
$$
With LASSO, the final model includes only four key predictors, which significantly improves interpretability. The coefficients provide direct insight into how each selected feature contributes to the UPDRS score. This sparse model performs well (MSE ≈ 20.4), showing a good balance between accuracy and simplicity.

### d). Repeat your analysis with a different random split of the training and test sets. Have the same features been selected in your final model?
```
 
```{r DAVID-NAMED-6, results='asis'}


When We repeated the analysis with a different random seed (from 123 to 321), which changed the training-test split. 
The test set Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the previous dataset was 20.414054, while for the new dataset, it decreased to 4.899441. This reduction indicates that the model trained with the new dataset performs better on the test set. 

The final model selected a slightly different set of features.
Under seed = 123, the selected features were: X9, X82, X83, X97
Under seed = 321, the selected features were: X83, X95, X97

While some features like X83 and X97 appeared in both models, others (e.g., X9, X82 and X95) were different. This indicates that the feature selection process is sensitive to the specific training-test split and that small changes in data partitioning can lead to different optimal subsets.

The final model formula list below:
\[
\text{UPDRS} = 25.4929 + 0.2028 \times X_{83} + 0.2533 \times X_{95} + 9.0117 \times X_{97}
\]

```

## Question 3
```{r DAVID-NAMED-7, results='asis'}
 

Base on the cross validation, the best alpha of Elastic Net in this dataset is 0.3, in the next step, the alpha will be set to 0.3 to obtain the best result.

### b). Plot the cross-validation results for your model

 
The plot shows the mean squared error (MSE) across different values of lambda. The green line represents `lambda.min` (with lowest MSE), and the red line is `lambda.1se` (within one standard error for simpler model).


### c). Make predictions on your test set using both lambda.min and lambda.1se, show the coeff icients of each model, report the MSE and/or RMSE of both, and the number of predictors used in each model.

 

### d).Which model would you choose? Justify your answer.

Based on the comparison of the two models using lambda.min and lambda.1se,We evaluated two elastic net regression models with alpha = 0.3, using lambda.min and lambda.1se. The model with lambda.min had a lower MSE of 11,412.89 and RMSE of 106.83, while the lambda.1se model had a slightly higher MSE of 13,078.75 and RMSE of 114.36.

In terms of complexity, the lambda.min model used 13 predictors, whereas the lambda.1se model used only 9 predictors, indicating stronger regularization.

This shows a typical trade-off:
lambda.min provides better predictive accuracy, but with more variables in the model.
lambda.1se gives a more parsimonious model (fewer predictors), which may be preferred for simplicity or interpretability, even at the cost of slightly higher error.

In real-world applications, especially when working with environmental or climate-related data, interpretability and generalizability are often more important than marginal gains in accuracy. A simpler model is also easier to communicate and deploy.

Therefore, the lambda.1se model strikes a better balance between performance and model simplicity.

The formula for the final model is as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{Y} =\ & 612.3961 \\
&+ 0.1671 \cdot \text{ALTITUDE} \\
&- 4.9645 \cdot \text{MEAN\_ANNUAL\_AIR\_TEMP} \\
&- 1.0373 \cdot \text{MEAN\_MONTHLY\_MIN\_TEMP} \\

\end{aligned}
$$

```
