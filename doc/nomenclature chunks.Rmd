#Base on the table above, it can be found that:

# Model Complexity:
# The Backward Selection model is more complex, retaining 44 variables.
# The Stepwise Selection model is simpler but efficient, retaining only 23 variables.
# This results in a more parsimonious model, which may improve interpretability and generalizability.

# Fit Quality:
# Both models have almost identical R² values, showing similar explanatory power.
# However, the Stepwise model has a higher adjusted R², which accounts for model complexity.

# Model Selection Criteria (AIC & BIC):
# Both AIC and BIC are lower for the Stepwise model, suggesting it achieves better fit with fewer variables.
# This indicates a better balance between model complexity and goodness of fit.

# Holdout MSE:
# The Stepwise model has a much lower MSE on the holdout set, suggesting better predictive performance and generalizability.

# Computation Time:
# Backward selection was faster, but the difference (~3.5s) is likely negligible for most practical purposes.

# Conclusion:
# The Stepwise model is preferred overall: it’s simpler, generalizes better, and performs better across most criteria
# (especially adjusted R², AIC, BIC, and holdout MSE), despite being slightly slower to compute.

```{r DAVID-NAMED-4, results='asis'}


### e). Please give a possible explanation of why one method is better than the other in this case,considering also results from backwards and stepwise selection.
# From the comparison of the four models (Ridge, LASSO, Backward, and Stepwise selection),
# LASSO demonstrates the best overall performance in this case, and here’s why:

# Lower Prediction Error:
# LASSO achieves the lowest Holdout MSE (61648.42) compared to Ridge (92275.39),
# Backward (89101.99), and Stepwise (69494.02), indicating LASSO generalises better to unseen data.
# Its lower CV MSE (27436.48) compared to Ridge’s (48080.05) further validates its robustness.

# Computational Efficiency:
# LASSO runs much faster (0.125 seconds) than Backward (9.823s) and Stepwise (14.149s),
# making it scalable for large datasets.
# Ridge (0.240s) is also fast but performs worse in prediction accuracy.

# Variable Sparsity:
# LASSO retains only 40 predictors (vs. Ridge’s 108 and Backward’s 43),
# reducing overfitting risk while maintaining interpretability.
# Ridge keeps all 108 predictors but shrinks their effects.
# Stepwise selects only 22 predictors, but has a higher Holdout MSE than LASSO,
# suggesting it might discard useful variables.

# Why LASSO Outperforms Backward/Stepwise:
# - Automatic Feature Selection:
#   LASSO’s L1 regularization shrinks irrelevant coefficients to exact zero,
#   avoiding the greedy pitfalls of stepwise methods, which can get stuck in suboptimal variable subsets.
# - Handling Multicollinearity:
#   LASSO and Ridge handle correlated predictors better than stepwise methods,
#   which often fail in high-dimensional settings.

# Summary:
# While Stepwise is simpler to interpret, its computational cost and higher error make it less practical here.
# Ridge retains all variables, leading to higher complexity and overfitting.
# LASSO balances accuracy, speed, and simplicity effectively, making it the superior choice for this dataset.
# Its ability to select key predictors while minimizing prediction error aligns well with the observed data patterns.

```{r DAVID-NAMED-5, results='asis'}  

#The R-squared value of 1 indicates a perfect fit on the training data. However, this is likely due to #overfitting, as the model is using 97 predictors with only 30 observations. In such cases, the model memorises #the data instead of learning meaningful relationships, which results in poor generalization to new data.

### b). Now use the LASSO to fit the training data, using leave-one-out cross-validation to find the tuning #parameter 𝜆. (This means 𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑠 = 30. You will also find it convenient to set 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 = 10\^𝑠𝑒𝑞(3,−1,100) and 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ = 1𝑒 −10). What is the optimal value of 𝜆? and what is the resulting test error?

## Question 3
 
 

Base on the cross validation, the best alpha of Elastic Net in this dataset is 0.3, in the next step, the alpha will be set to 0.3 to obtain the best result.

### b). Plot the cross-validation results for your model

 
The plot shows the mean squared error (MSE) across different values of lambda. The green line represents `lambda.min` (with lowest MSE), and the red line is `lambda.1se` (within one standard error for simpler model).


### c). Make predictions on your test set using both lambda.min and lambda.1se, show the coeff icients of each model, report the MSE and/or RMSE of both, and the number of predictors used in each model.

 

### d).Which model would you choose? Justify your answer.

Based on the comparison of the two models using lambda.min and lambda.1se,We evaluated two elastic net regression models with alpha = 0.3, using lambda.min and lambda.1se. The model with lambda.min had a lower MSE of 11,412.89 and RMSE of 106.83, while the lambda.1se model had a slightly higher MSE of 13,078.75 and RMSE of 114.36.

In terms of complexity, the lambda.min model used 13 predictors, whereas the lambda.1se model used only 9 predictors, indicating stronger regularization.

This shows a typical trade-off:
lambda.min provides better predictive accuracy, but with more variables in the model.
lambda.1se gives a more parsimonious model (fewer predictors), which may be preferred for simplicity or interpretability, even at the cost of slightly higher error.

In real-world applications, especially when working with environmental or climate-related data, interpretability and generalizability are often more important than marginal gains in accuracy. A simpler model is also easier to communicate and deploy.

Therefore, the lambda.1se model strikes a better balance between performance and model simplicity.
